## Fall 2021

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



**Meeting Times:**

 - **Wednesdays (3:00p-4:15p):** This class session is reserved for you to work as a team, unencumbered by "interference" from the faculty.  We will have potential conflicts for the use of KEC 118 due to having multiple teams giving presentations on alternate days (Wednesdays for Radio Telescope and Fridays for Privileged Walk).  Since the Radio Telescope team has specific hardware that they need to work with, some of it located in KEC 118, that team might take precedence, at times, in which case I will reserve KEC 123 for your use.
 
 - **Fridays (3:00p-4:15p):** This class session is reserved for weekly status updates, assignment presentations, and Milestone presentations.  We will likely meet **in-person** in KEC 123 while also using Zoom for all weekly status updates, assignment presentations, and milestone - unless otherwise noted.  Your York College Psychology clients (Dr. Perri Druen and Dr. Randi Shedlosky) will likely be in attendance at these meetings, as well.  We will be using Zoom from your personal computers so that Dr. Druen can attend (via Zoom).  We'll work this out during the first week of class.  NOTE: It is not unusual for these in-class sessions to run past 4:15 at times, especially during the status reports and milestone presentations.  If you have another class scheduled immediately following this class, please let me know, and I will try to make accomodations. For Milestone presentations, you might need to make accommodations with your other professors.<br>
 
**Location:** KEC 118 and/or KEC123 (the front 2 benches are reserved for the Privileged Walk team, and the back 2 benches are reserved for the Radio Telescope project).

### Course Description

This is the first year for the Privileged Walk project, with two faculty members from the York College Psychology program serving as your clients (Dr. Perri Druen and Dr. Randi Shedlosky).  You will be developing this project from scratch, acquiring all of your information for your project proposal, Use Cases and User Stories, and Requirements from your clients.  They will also establish your tasks and priorities in consultation with me, and with your input, as you plan and develop the sprint schedule for your agile development approach.

This project will likely break into 2-3 teams, across 5 people (team members can be on multiple teams):
- Front End (UI / UX)
- Backend and Database
- Possibly Data Visualization

Drs. Druen and Shedlosky will introduce to the Privileged Walk concept during the first week of class.

It is highly likely that this will be a two-semester project, spanning both CS481 and CS482.  I highly recommend that you continue working on this project in CS482 in the Spring, as it will provide you with a valuable year-long, comprehensive, client-based, team project experience, and CS482 counts as a CS elective toward your CS major requirements.

**Prerequisites:**  CS 320 with a grade of 2.0 or higher (or PC from Spring 2020)<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:**  None

### Grading Policy

Your team's grade will be determined as a weighted average of the grades on the 7 assignments, as follows:

-   Assignment 1 - Team Project Proposal - **5%**
-   Assignment 2 - Weekly Progress Journals, Status Reports, Demonstrations - **20%**
-   Assignment 3 - Requirements - **10%**
-   Assignment 4 - Analysis and Design - **15%**
-   Assignment 5 - Minimal Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 6 - 50% Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 7 - Final Working System (10%), Presentation (10%), Technical Report (10%) - **30%**

NOTE: You will be presenting your work for each of these assignments in class on the Fridays they are due.  On the Fridays that you do not have an assignment or milestone due, you will be presenting progress reports, as part of assignment 2.  Your weekly journal entries are **due EVERY Friday by 3:00p, immediately prior to EVERY Friday class period, regardless of what else is due that day.**

Individual course grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale according to the following table, and will be determined from your weekly progress journal entries and reports, combined with your team's grade, **multiplied by your individual effort factor determined from the results of your mid-term and final peer evaluations**:

| Range             |  Grade   |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| ≥ 90 and ≤ 100    |   4.0    |
| ≥ 87 and &lt; 90  |   3.5    |
| ≥ 80 and &lt; 87  |   3.0    |
| ≥ 77 and &lt; 80  |   2.5    |
| ≥ 70 and &lt; 77  |   2.0    |
| ≥ 60 and &lt; 70  |   1.0    |
| &lt; 60           |    0     |

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to
principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore,
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic
dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating,
plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc.,
and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others
and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic
dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing
and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty
member then has ten business days from that written notification to
the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and
the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic
dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The
faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for
the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to
the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw
from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty,
unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or
is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic
Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must
discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business
days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee
through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the
Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the
charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the
faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a
hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation,
suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is
the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification
to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student
Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the
charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic
probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe
the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit
a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of
receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

### Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability in need of a classroom accommodation and have not already registered with Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, please contact her at 815-1785 or [lmille18@ycp.edu](mailto:lmille18@ycp.edu) to discuss policies and procedures related to disability services and to establish the accommodations for which you are eligible.
